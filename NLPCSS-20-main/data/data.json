Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the \u2018smartest person.\u2019 Besides, America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning.\nEX-STARBUCKS CEO HOWARD SCHULTZ &aposSERIOUSLY&apos MULLS PRESIDENTIAL RUN, BASHES TRUMP AS &aposNOT QUALIFIED&apos\nThe president\u2019s tweet comes after Schultz&aposs interview on CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d where he revealed he was \u201cseriously thinking\u201d about running for president in 2020 as a \u201ccentrist independent,\u201d and challenged Trump\u2019s fitness for office.\n\u201cWe\u2019re living at a most fragile time, not only the fact that this president is not qualified to be the president, but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what\u2019s necessary on behalf of the American people,\u201d Schultz said, specifically citing the national debt as \u201ca reckless example, not only of Republicans but of Democrats, as well, as a reckless failure of their constitutional responsibility.\u201d\nA fiery response from Trump was expected. When told during the interview that Trump would be tweeting about him in response, Schultz said, \"I&aposve become bored with President Trump and his tweets.\"\nSchultz, though, is taking heat from both sides amid fears from Democrats he could play the role of spoiler, especially considering Schultz described himself as a \u201clifelong Democrat\u201d yet is now contemplating a run as an independent.\n\u201cHoward Shultz running as an independent isn\u2019t about bringing people together,\u201d Tina Podlodowski, the Democratic Party chair in Schultz\u2019s home state of Washington, said in a statement Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s about one person: Howard Schultz.\u201d\nNeera Tanden, the president for the liberal Center for American Progress, also blasted Schultz, saying she would boycott Starbucks if he ran.\n\u201cVanity projects that help destroy democracy are disgusting,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m not giving a penny that will end up in the election coffers of a guy who will help Trump win.\u201d\nHowever, some of his views might also clash with a Democratic Party gearing up to unseat Trump. Some potential nominees, including Massachusetts 2020 candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris, have endorsed single-payer health care, heavily taxing the rich or free tuition at public colleges. Schultz has criticized such proposals as unrealistic and instead emphasized expanding the economy and curbing entitlements.\n2020 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY GETS CROWDED\n\"It concerns me that so many voices within the Democratic Party are going so far to the left,\" Schultz told CNBC last June. \"I ask myself, &aposHow are we going to pay for all these things?&apos in terms of things like single-payer or people espousing the fact that the government is going to give everyone a job. I don&apost think that&aposs realistic.\"\nDuring his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, Schultz dodged a question about whether his potential independent run would make him a spoiler for the Democratic nominee.\n\u201cI wanna see the American people win,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanna see America win. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a Democrat, Independent, Libertarian, Republican. Bring me your ideas. And I will be an independent person, who will embrace those ideas. Because I\u2019m not, in any way, in bed with a party.\u201d\nNo third-party or independent candidate has won over 5 percent of the popular vote since Ross Perot in 1996. But Schultz argued that a majority of the electorate is \u201cexhausted\u201d with politics.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\u201cWhat we know, factually, is that over 40 percent of the electorate is either a registered Independent or currently affiliates themselves as an Independent,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir trust has been broken. And they are looking for a better choice.\u201d\nFox News&apos Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.", "misc": {"time": "2019-01-28 16:10:44.680484", "topics": "Election: Presidential", "author": ["Brooke Singman", "| Fox News"]}}

The partial shutdown spanned more than a month.\nMr. Trump signed the bill even though it doesn\u2019t include new money for construction on his desired U.S.-Mexico border wall, which the White House repeatedly insisted be part of the deal.\nThat\u2019s a win for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders, who said over the last month that they would not support additional funding for the wall and that they would not negotiate border security while the government remained closed.\n\u201cI think ultimately he\u2019ll be judged by what happens at the end of this process, not by what happened this week,\u201d Mr. Mulvaney said of the president.\nMr. Trump said over the weekend that 21 days \u201cgoes very quickly.\u201d\n\u201cNegotiations with Democrats will start immediately,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cWill not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in.
