    "In this project I will attempting to train a model to predict news media bias. In order to do this I will be utilizing the dataset NLPCSS-20 from the Association for Computational Linguistics which can be found on Github. The dataset is a collection or corpus contrived of 6,964 news articles. The labels of how we describe the corpus are the following:\n",
    "- title: title of news\n",
    "- content: content\n",
    "- source: source of the content\n",
    "- allsides-bias: bias (left, center or right)\n",
    "- misc: aurhor, date, etc\n",
    "- adfontes_fair: how fair is the news article (bias, neutral or unknown)\n",
    "- adfontes_political: how political bias skewed the article is (bias, neutral or unknown)\n",
    "- event_id:event id\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a text classification problem as how we are trying to classify combination of strings that demonstrate wheter a news content is politically bias or not. The combination of strings is the content itself, it is then labeled with how bias that content is. \n"
